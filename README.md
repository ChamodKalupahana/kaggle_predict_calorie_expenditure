# 🥗 Kaggle - Predict Calorie Expenditure

📅 **Last updated: 11 June 2025**

Welcome! This is my GitHub repo for the [Kaggle Calories Prediction Playground Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e25).  
The competition has now concluded, so I won’t be making further updates.  

However, feel free to browse through my notes and code — I hope you find something useful!
