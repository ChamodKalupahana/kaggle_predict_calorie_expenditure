didn’t work very well, going to try normalise it since it just looks like this atm

that ended up giving a worse result! so it looks like adding bmi is not helping the model and furthermore normalising the data leads to worse predictions

- this shows that it can draw better conclusions from the dataset while height and weight remain in the dataset

what if i try keep height and weight in the dataset alongisde the unnormalised bmi

we can confirm that was defineltly better, but it’s just not better than not having the bmi there
