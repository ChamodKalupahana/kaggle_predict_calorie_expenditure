# inital optimisiation

just doing this to see how the model does

moved to adamw, 5 epochs and 16→8→4→1

clearly it is fitting which is great but it is plateauing quite quickly

- this is a very simple model that shouldn’t have enough neurons to solve the problem
- so we should just expect it to reach a min loss quickly and stay there

oh lol

this one was actually worse haha
