so i got the model fit to work but i’ve realised that output needs to be id and calories

so i need to redefine the model

the predictions are so bad lol but it looks correct at

we can either submit the output file manually or run the notebook as a submission and kaggle find the “submission.csv” and use that for the submission

i’ve realised that i let the model predict the id values here which is wrong, we just want it to predict the calories and we’ll manually append the id values later
