# getting simple model to work

looking at other kaggle notebooks, looks like we can just import

i reckon im going to create a new copy of the current notebook and move over to lgbm

looks like we can just define a simple model that might work with our dataset

yep. this just ran

- think this is because all the parameters are optional

but this doesnâ€™t work fitting

im seeing in a few ways that other notebooks use a regressor model, i can try that
